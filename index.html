            <p> TV Girl is an American indie pop band from San Diego, California, there are some their popular album covers: </p>
                <p>If you want to get to know the band better, I recommend these songs: 'Cigarettes out the Window', 'Birds Don't Sing', 'Pantyhose', 'The Getaway', 'Not allowed', 'Blue hair' and maybe 'Heaven is a Bedroom'. And you can also listen to an old podcast called 'Dangerously Yours', from which they took samples for their songs.</p>
